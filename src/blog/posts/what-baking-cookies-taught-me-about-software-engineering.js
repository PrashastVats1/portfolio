  excerpt:  "I tried to bake cookies without an oven. What started as a kitchen experiment turned into a surprisingly useful framework for thinking about software engineering.",

    { type: "paragraph", text: "I tried to bake cookies without an oven. Every recipe assumed you had one. I had an air fryer, trial and error, and a kitchen that smelled increasingly like burnt sugar." },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "Somewhere between the third failed batch and the first one that actually worked, I realized I was doing the same thing I do at work — adapting constraints, testing assumptions, iterating fast." },
    { type: "heading",   text: "The Recipe as Code" },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "A recipe has a structure that maps surprisingly well to software. Once you see it, you can't unsee it." },
    { type: "list", items: [
      "Ingredients = Dependencies. Just like package.json lists what you need, a recipe lists its inputs. Missing one changes everything.",
      "\"Mix melted butter and sugar first\" = Order of Operations. Dependencies matter. You can't add eggs to cold butter. Same in code: initialize before you use.",
      "\"Dough will be sticky\" = Known Issues. Good documentation warns you about the hard parts. Good code comments do the same.",
      "\"Bake a single piece first\" = Test-Driven Development. Don't ship to production without a test run. I baked one cookie, found it too salty, fixed the ratio, then scaled.",
      "\"Adjust accordingly\" = Configuration over hardcoding. Small cookies need a different temperature — you adjust a parameter, not the whole recipe.",
    ]},
    { type: "heading",   text: "The Debug Loop" },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "Batch one: burnt on the outside, raw inside. Too high a temperature for too long — classic premature optimization. I was trying to go fast and skipped the warm-up." },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "Batch two: flat and greasy. Butter was too warm when I added it. A state management issue — the system was in the wrong state when I triggered the next step." },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "Batch three: got it right. Not because I followed the recipe perfectly, but because I understood why each step existed." },
    { type: "heading",   text: "The Engineering Parallel" },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "The best engineers I've worked with don't just follow instructions — they understand the intent behind them. That's what lets them adapt when the environment changes, when a dependency breaks, or when the requirements shift halfway through." },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "The cookie recipe didn't change. The oven did. Knowing why each step existed meant I could translate it to a completely different context and still get the same result." },
    { type: "heading",   text: "The Takeaway" },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "Good systems — whether they're cookie recipes or software architectures — share the same properties: clear inputs, defined order of operations, documented edge cases, testable units, and configurable parameters." },
    { type: "paragraph", text: "Ten cookies made it to the office. Same process, different medium. Next time you're stuck on a problem, it might help to ask: what would the recipe look like?" },
